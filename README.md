# Correctonym

How well do you know the social media acronyms people use all the time, specially on Twitter ? Are you one of many (like me) who googles the full form of the acronym (such as fwiw, idk) while reading tweets?
Well, you are not alone and don't need to feel FOMO..

Correctonym  is a fun and simple interactive app I made to test your knowledge of social media acronyms. The app presents 20 acronyms as a question with 3 choices for each question. You just need to select the correct longform of each acronym and swipe for next question. Simple, fun and knowledge gainer.
Correct answer will be highlighted in Green, while, a wrong answer in Red.

There are no losers or winners and there are no points to gain while you are answering a question. Even if you select a wrong answer, no worries, you can try again or go back to previous question and try again. 

## Why no scores or winners/losers?

My intention while developing this app is to be able to help people know more about the acronyms and what they stand for, when they come across in day to day life while browsing internet or reading tweets. So, it's win-win situation for the users.
